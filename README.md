# FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK
holy shhit i caught a bee and the crushed it until purple jelly came out of its anus. in this jelly i tasted the liquor of the great gods of babadook, but unbeknonwst to me, it wasn't jelly at all! --- each cell was in fact an egg, fertilized and slowly developing into something more. the nature of this process of fertilization indiactes that the eggs must destroy and consume each other in what may be considered an autocannibalistic fashion when viewing the jelly as a single unit. the fact is, it eats itself so that the toughest cell-eggs survive. they will grow and grow until a single baby effectively develops. i, having consumed only part of the bee's purple abdomen-jelly-egg-cells, had only half a child now developing inside me. it would grow and grow and begin to feast on my internal organs, til emerging and seaking its lost counterpart. the duel between them would be of epic proportions, they must battle until one declares itself the victor and will kill and/or fuck its counterpart. preferrably both.
